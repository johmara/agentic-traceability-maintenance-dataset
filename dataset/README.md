# Greta Dataset — ReferenceManager Demonstration

This dataset accompanies the paper *Greta: Keeping Feature Structure Visible in Agentic LLM Coding* (ASE 2026, Tools and Datasets track).

## ReferenceManager

A web API for managing research paper references, built with .NET 9, Entity Framework Core, and SQLite. Developed entirely through agentic coding using Claude Code with Greta active from the first prompt.

**Final state**: 85 source files, 2 971 lines of C# application code, 25 features across four top-level concerns.

### Build and run

```bash
cd dataset/ReferenceManager
dotnet run
# API + Scalar UI available at http://localhost:5062/scalar/v1
```

### Run tests

```bash
cd dataset/ReferenceManager
dotnet test
```

## Demonstration transcripts

`demonstration/` contains one file per evolution step — verbatim transcripts of the agentic coding session, showing the developer prompt, Claude Code's tool calls and output, and Greta's automatic feature model update after each coding cycle.

| File | Evolution | Feature model change | Type |
|------|-----------|---------------------|------|
| `evolution-point1.txt` | Ev. 1 | + `Database`, `ApiDocs`, `Papers` | Add |
| `evolution-point2.txt` | Ev. 2 | + `Collections`, `Versioning` | Add |
| `evolution-point3.txt` | Ev. 3 | + `Tags` | Add |
| `evolution-point4.txt` | Ev. 4 | + `Favorites` | Add |
| `evolution-point5.txt` | Ev. 5 | `Tags` + `Collections` → `Groups` | Merge |
| `evolution-point6.txt` | Ev. 6 | + `Papers.ImportBibTex` | Add |
| `evolution-point7.txt` | Ev. 7 | + `Papers.ExportBibTex` | Add |
| `evolution-point8.txt` | Ev. 8 | `Papers.Authors` → `Authors` | Split |
| `evolution-point9.txt` | Ev. 9 | + `Papers.SearchPapers` | Add |
| `evolution-point10.txt` | Ev. 10 | − `Favorites` | Remove |

`demonstration/prompts.md` lists all 27 developer prompts across the 10 evolution steps.  
`demonstration/result-stats.md` reports final cloc statistics for the codebase.

## Redaction note

Personal and organizational identifiers have been redacted: the developer's name is replaced with *A. Developer*, the employing organization with *The Company*, and local file system paths are relative.
